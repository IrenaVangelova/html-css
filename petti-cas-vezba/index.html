                <p>Jennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969), also known by her nickname J.Lo, is an American singer,
                    actress, and dancer. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color, where
                    she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading
                    role in the 1997 Selena biopic of the same name, Lopez became the first Latin actress to earn over
                    US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), and
                    established herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.</p>
                <p>Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped
                    propel the Latin pop movement in American music, and later starred in the psychological horror The
                    Cell (2000). With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her romantic comedy
                    The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number-one album and film in the
                    same week. Her 2002 release, J to tha Lâ€“O! The Remixes, became the first remix album in history to
                    debut atop the US Billboard 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album This Is Me...
                    Then and starred in the film Maid in Manhattan.</p>
